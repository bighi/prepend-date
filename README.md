# prepend-date
Small python script that prepends the creation date to a file name.

## How it works

You call the script with a filename as argument. Then it will change the filename to prepend the creation date.

Example:

*./prepend-date this-is-a-filename.txt*

Result:

The file will be called *2017-11-16 this-is-a-filename.txt*
